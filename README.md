# magic-RPG

a game for my english midterm because the other project options were boring :P
this game was made in Unity 6, you play through as a wizard apprentice trying to rescue his sister from an evil sorceror. 

this was made for [hackclub](hackclub.com)'s [moonshot](moonshot.hacklcub.com) program.
