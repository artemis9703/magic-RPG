# magic-RPG

a game for my english midterm because the other project options were boring :P
this game was made in Unity 6, you play through as a wizard apprentice trying to rescue his sister from an evil sorceror. 

this was made for [hackclub](https://hackclub.com/)'s [moonshot](https://moonshot.hacklcub.com/) program.
